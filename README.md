# phlask
Phlask is an adaptation of the philv2 pipetting robot that is more compact and has a completely different software package. The main difference is that it is run by a raspberry pi that uses a flask server to interface with the users. The server allows programming and viewing of past experiments as well as manual control of the robot via web interface.
